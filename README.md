# ‚òÅÔ∏è Task 5: Create and Connect to a Cloud Database Instance (MSSQL)

## üéØ Objective
To understand how *Cloud Databases* work by creating and connecting to a *managed SQL database instance* and performing basic operations (CRUD).

This task helps in learning:
- How to *create* a database in the cloud
- How to *connect* from SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- How to perform *basic SQL operations* (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- *Platform:* AWS RDS (MySQL) / Azure SQL / Local SQL Server  
- *Client Tool:* SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)  
- *Database Engine:* Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Followed

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Cloud Database Instance
- Logged in to *AWS Console ‚Üí RDS*  
- Chose *MySQL (Free Tier)* or used *Azure SQL Server*  
- Set:
  - *Instance name:* intern-db
  - *Username:* admin
  - *Password:* (strong password)
- Enabled *public access*
- Waited until instance status showed *Available*

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Access
- Added my *local IP* in the security group inbound rule  
- Allowed port *3306 (MySQL)* or *1433 (MSSQL)* for SQL Server  
- Copied the *endpoint / public IP*

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Connect to the Database
- Opened *SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)*  
- Used:
  - Server name: your-endpoint.amazonaws.com
  - Authentication: SQL Server Authentication  
  - Login: admin
  - Password: yourpassword
- Clicked *Connect* ‚úÖ

## üß± SQL Commands Used

```sql
-- Use database
USE intern_demo;
GO

-- Drop table if already exists
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS students;
GO

-- Create new table
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    domain VARCHAR(30),
    score INT
);
GO

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO students (name, domain, score)
VALUES 
('Aarav', 'Cloud', 95),
('Diya', 'DevOps', 89);
GO

-- View data
SELECT * FROM students;
GO

-- Update data
UPDATE students
SET score = 98
WHERE name = 'Aarav';
GO

-- Delete a record
DELETE FROM students
WHERE name = 'Diya';
GO

-- Final view
SELECT * FROM students;
GO

üí¨ Interview Prep

Question	Simple Answer

What is DBaaS?	Database-as-a-Service ‚Äî managed by the cloud provider.
Why use cloud databases?	No need for manual setup, auto backups, easy scaling, high availability.
What‚Äôs the difference between self-hosted and managed DB?	Managed DBs are handled by the provider (patching, backup, HA).
How to connect securely?	Use your IP in inbound rules, use SSL, avoid 0.0.0.0/0.
What is scalability?	Ability to increase resources easily (CPU, storage).

üßπ Clean-up

After testing, delete or stop your instance to avoid unnecessary charges:

In AWS ‚Üí RDS ‚Üí Databases ‚Üí Select your DB ‚Üí Delete

Uncheck snapshot (for testing)

Confirm deletion ‚úÖ
